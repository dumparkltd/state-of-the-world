  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.title": "FAQs",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.uncertainty": "Why do some uncertainty bands go under 0 or above 10?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.uncertainty": "The short answer is that this sometimes happens when we convert our statistical calculations into scores from 0 to 10, and it doesn’t mean anything special.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.methodologyUncertainty": "For more information please see our methodology handbook",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.methodologyUncertaintyURL": "https://humanrightsmeasurement.org/methodology-handbook",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.uncertaintyLong": "The more detailed answer is that when we calculate our civil and political rights scores, the results could theoretically take on any value, but in practice, the scores mostly range between -3 and 3. We shift the average scores to a scale that ranges from 0 to 10 to make the scores a little easier for the average reader to understand. However, because there are not real limits on the scores that come out of our model, we sometimes end up with uncertainty bands that range beyond 10 or below 0. We still present those bands completely – and don’t just cut them off at 0 or 10 – to accurately show our level of certainty in the country's score.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.scale": "Why are the two types of metrics not on the same scale?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.scale": "HRMI metrics use two different methodologies that have different scales and interpretations. The scores for the civil and political rights metrics are a score out of 10 indicating the extent to which the government in the country respected that right. By contrast, the scores for the economic and social rights metrics are percentage scores. Their interpretation depends on the benchmark used. When using the income-adjusted benchmark, the scores tell you the percentage level of enjoyment achieved on that right relative to what should be feasible for a country with that income level. In other words, it tells you the extent to which the country is meeting its immediate obligation to fulfil the right “to the maximum of its available resources.” This is not the same as the extent to which people in the country enjoy the right. When using the global best benchmark, the scores tell you the percentage level of enjoyment achieved on that right relative to the highest score attained by the best performing countries at any income level. Achieving the global best benchmark is consistent with meeting its full obligation to fulfill the right aspect concerned.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.year": "Why are the two sets of metrics not for the same year?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.year": "All metrics presented are the most recent data available. Where shown, the civil and political rights metrics are for calendar year 2019. Comparisons with 2018 (and for some countries 2017) are also available. The economic and social rights metrics are from the 2020 update of the International Social and Economic Rights Fulfilment (SERF) Index, which covers the period from 2007 to 2017. The data used for each year are the most recently available data as of that year. HRMI graphs use the most recently available data from the full dataset.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.standards": "What is the difference between the two assessment standards?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.measureRightESR": "How does the HRMI methodology convert the above indicators into the {metricLower} metric?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESR": "All HRMI measures of economic and social rights have been produced using official statistics collected by national governments and harmonised by international organisations. For each indicator, our methodology compares the observed level of enjoyment of that dimension of human rights to the enjoyment level that other countries have shown can be achieved at that per-capita income level. HRMI economic and social rights metrics thus show how well the State is using its available resources to ensure that people enjoy these rights to the maximum extent possible. ",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesIntro": "Three things should be kept in mind when interpreting HRMI economic and social rights metrics",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesOne": "A score of 100% does NOT imply that everyone in the country enjoys the right. Rather, it tells us that the country’s right enjoyment level is on par with the historically best-performing countries at the same per-capita income level.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesTwo": "A score of 100% does NOT mean there is no room for improvement. Countries with high HRMI scores still need to innovate to deepen and extend human rights enjoyment further than has been done in the past.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesThree": "The fact that a high income country earns a high HRMI score on a right does NOT imply that all population subgroups (e.g. women or indigenous people) in that country enjoy the right equally.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.measureRightCPR": "How has HRMI measured the {metricLower} score?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightCPR": "Each civil and political right metric has been produced from responses to a survey of in-country human rights experts. Respondents’ answers to questions about the frequency of violations of each civil and political right were combined using a statistical model that ensures the comparability of responses across countries. This results in a distribution of estimated levels of respect for each right in each country, represented by the scores and uncertainty bands shown throughout the data visualisations. Other information about who was identified as at risk for human rights abuse was also collected from our respondents, and can be accessed from the 'people at risk' tabs on each country page.",
