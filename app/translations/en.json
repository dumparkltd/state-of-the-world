  "hrmi.indicators-about.pisa-science": "Percentage of students achieving level 3 or better on the PISA science test.  Achievement levels run from 1 to 6.  At Level 3, students can draw upon moderately complex content knowledge to identify or construct explanations of familiar phenomena.  In less familiar or more complex situations, they can construct explanations with relevant cueing or support.  They can draw on elements of procedural or epistemic knowledge to carry out a simple experiment in a constrained context.  Level 3 students are able to distinguish between scientific and non-scientific issues and identify the evidence supporting a scientific claim.",

At Level 3, students can execute clearly described procedures, including those that require sequential decisions.  Their interpretations are sufficiently sound to be a base for building a simple model or for selecting and applying simple problem-solving strategies.  Students at this level can interpret and use representations based on different information sources and reason directly from them. They typically show some ability to handle percentages, fractions and decimal numbers, and to work with proportional relationships.  Their solutions reflect that they have engaged in basic interpretation and reasoning.",

Tasks at this level [level 3] require the reader to locate, and in some cases recognise the relationship between, several pieces of information that must meet multiple conditions.  Interpretative tasks at this level require the reader to integrate several parts of a text in order to identify a main idea, understand a relationship or construe the meaning of a word or phrase.  They need to take into account many features in comparing, contrasting, or categorising.",

Prevalence of stunting is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months.

FOR GENDERS: % (gender) children surviving to age 5 is 100 minus the (gender under-five mortality rate/10). Under-five mortality rate is the probability per 1,000 that a newborn (gender) baby will die before reaching age five, if subject to gender age-specific mortality rates.",
  "hrmi.indicators-about.contraception": "The modern contraceptive prevalence rate. The modern contraceptive prevalence rate is the percentage of women who are practicing, or whose sexual partners are practicing, at least one modern method of contraception.

  "hrmi.indicators-about.safe-sanitation": "Percentage of people using safely managed sanitation.  Safely managed sanitation is defined as use of improved facilities which are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed in situ or transported and treated off-site. Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.",

  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.measureRightCPR": "How has HRMI measured the {metricLower} score?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.measureRightESR": "How does the HRMI methodology convert the statistical indicators into the {metricLower} metric?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.scale": "Why are the two sets of metrics not on the same scale?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.standards": "What is the difference between the two assessment standards?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.uncertainty": "Why do some uncertainty bands go under 0 or above 10?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.year": "Why are the two sets of metrics not for the same year?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESR": "All HRMI measures of economic and social rights have been produced using official statistics collected by national governments and harmonised by international organisations. \n\n For the 'global best' benchmark, the methodology compares the observed level of enjoyment in a country to the level that other countries have shown can be achieved at any income level.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesIntro": "Three things should be kept in mind when interpreting HRMI's economic and social rights metrics",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesOne": "A score of 100% does NOT imply that everyone in the country enjoys the right. Rather, it tells us that the country’s right enjoyment level is on par with the historically best-performing countries.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesTwo": "A score of 100% does NOT mean there is no room for improvement. Countries with high HRMI scores still need to innovate to deepen and extend human rights enjoyment further than has been done in the past.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesThree": "The fact that a high income country earns a high HRMI score on a right does NOT imply that all population subgroups (e.g. women or indigenous people) in that country enjoy the right equally.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightCPR": "HRMI measures all civil and political rights using a survey of in-country human rights experts. \n\n Asking questions about the frequency of violations of each right, HRMI uses a statistical model to compare responses across countries, and over time. \n\n The results are shown as an estimated score out of 10, within an uncertainty band.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.scale": "HRMI metrics use two different methodologies that have different scales and interpretations. \n\n The scores for the economic and social rights metrics are percentage scores. For the 'global best' benchmark the scores tell you how well the country is doing compared to the best performing countries at any income level. \n\n By contrast, the scores for the civil and political rights metrics are a score out of 10, indicating the extent to which the government in the country respected that right (10 is the best a country can do). These scores are produced using an expert survey methodology.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.uncertainty": "The short answer is that this sometimes happens when we convert our statistical calculations into scores from 0 to 10, and it doesn’t mean anything special.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.uncertaintyLong": "The more detailed answer is that when we calculate our civil and political rights scores, the results could theoretically take on any value. Because there are not real limits on the scores that come out of our model, we sometimes end up with uncertainty bands that range beyond 10 or below 0. We still present those bands completely – and don’t just cut them off at 0 or 10 – to accurately show our level of certainty in the country's score.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.year": "All metrics presented are the most recent data available. \n\n The economic and social rights metrics draw on data from international databases, where the data for the most recent scores are usually from a few years ago. Where underlying data is not available for a year, scores are based on the most recently available data before that year (limited to 10 years). \n\n The civil and political rights metrics scores shown are for the year the survey was conducted.",
